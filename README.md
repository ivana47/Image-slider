# Image-slider
Factory d.o.o project 2023.

style.css and index.js are edited source files that I haven't deleted.
After that, I created an SCSS preprocessor, which was minified into minifStyles.css and included in index.html.
Then, I transpiled the JavaScript file using Babel (babel.js) and minified it into minifBabel.js, which was also included in index.html.
